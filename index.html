<p>which normalizes directory listings to unicode normal form C (NFC).
Useful for subversion and other tools in context with Umlauts and other unicode issues on mixed OS environments.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h2>

<p>Any decent OS does not really care about unicode equivalence in their filesystem. They store what they get, and most get
the filenames in NFC normalized form.</p>

<p>All supported filesystems on Mac OS X will normalize the paths. The path will be normalized into NFD and it will be given back that way when listing the filesystem.</p>

<p>This is a problem with subversion and other versioning or file replication applications in mixed OS environments.
The subversion folks are aware of that: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/subversion/NonNormalizingUnicodeCompositionAwareness">http://wiki.apache.org/subversion/NonNormalizingUnicodeCompositionAwareness</a>
but there is no visible progress towards a decent workaround.
Note: my tests on Mac OS X 10.9 show that not only HFS+ is affected, but also fat (MS-DOS) and nfs mounts on OS X.</p>

<p>This fuse filesystems mitigates the problem by mounting a path from within a HFS+ partition and exporting
it as a Volume to a dedicated location.
Now just point your favourite svn client (such as the commandline client) to that exported Volume and
check out and work as if you had a decent, sane and working filesystem.</p>

<a id="status-of-the-code" class="anchor" href="#status-of-the-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status of the code</h2>

<p>This is quite experimental and not well tested yet. Feedback is very welcome.</p>

<h2>
<a id="issues" class="anchor" href="#issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Issues</h2>

<p>Of course this fixes only the filesystem layer. When operating directly on a repository using an svn client, the user must take care not to enter NFD normalized data when renaming or tagging/branching objects. First tests show that typing Umlauts won't be a problem, the input is NFC normalized. But copy-pasting from the console listing will be a problem. The user should be aware of that (unless the client software mitigates that. But there is none afaik).</p>
