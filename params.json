{"name":"Nfcfs","tagline":"Passthrough filesystem for OS X to workaround svn unicode and Umlaut issues","body":"Passthrough filesystem for OS X\r\n===============================\r\n\r\nwhich normalizes directory listings to unicode normal form C (NFC).\r\nUseful for subversion and other tools in context with Umlauts and other unicode issues on mixed OS environments.\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nAny decent OS does not really care about unicode equivalence in their filesystem. They store what they get, and most get\r\nthe filenames in NFC normalized form.\r\n\r\nAll supported filesystems on Mac OS X will normalize the paths. The path will be normalized into NFD and it will be given back that way when listing the filesystem.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem with subversion and other versioning or file replication applications in mixed OS environments.\r\nThe subversion folks are aware of that: http://wiki.apache.org/subversion/NonNormalizingUnicodeCompositionAwareness\r\nbut there is no visible progress towards a decent workaround.\r\nNote: my tests on Mac OS X 10.9 show that not only HFS+ is affected, but also fat (MS-DOS) and nfs mounts on OS X.\r\n\r\nThis fuse filesystems mitigates the problem by mounting a path from within a HFS+ partition and exporting\r\nit as a Volume to a dedicated location.\r\nNow just point your favourite svn client (such as the commandline client) to that exported Volume and\r\ncheck out and work as if you had a decent, sane and working filesystem.\r\n\r\n2015 Patrick Atamaniuk\r\n\r\nStatus of the code\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThis is quite experimental and not well tested yet. Feedback is very welcome.\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n------\r\n\r\nOf course this fixes only the filesystem layer. When operating directly on a repository using an svn client, the user must take care not to enter NFD normalized data when renaming or tagging/branching objects. First tests show that typing Umlauts won't be a problem, the input is NFC normalized. But copy-pasting from the console listing will be a problem. The user should be aware of that (unless the client software mitigates that. But there is none afaik).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
